 # What was the ticket?

No ticket - Jeremy asked to raise up the navbar so that it does not bleed into the our mission text.
 
 # What did I do?
 
 I changed the styling in the navbar container div to have a small left and top positioning value.
 
 # How did I test it?
 
 I altered the dimensions of the screen to maximumx width and maximum height and checked whether the navbar overlapped with text, and also
 inspected at minimum and maximum zoom.

 # What could go wrong in the future? What parts of your code should the reviewer pay the most attention to?
 
 Ultimately, this change can only fully be ironed out when the new navbar is pushed to main. That navbar has different dimensions which make it much easier
 to fit alongside text. Furthermore, the weare-cards-resizing branch also changes some of the text spacing on the OurMissionSection page to make the text fit better, so more work may be needed in the future to precisely arrange everything. However, that work must be done after the About section is fully updated.
