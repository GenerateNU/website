                  Halfway through the semester, hardware and software project teams set up demonstrations in the Sherman Center to unveil the work theyâ€™ve accomplished so far. We explore in-progress apps, gather user-testing data, play with hardware projects, and hang out with people from across the org in a fun, science-fair-esque format.

                  Every semester ends with our culminating event: Showcase. We get all fancied-up and celebrate the semesters' accomplishments with our teammates, clients, friends, families, professors and peers. Completed projects are shown off in all their glory, delicious food is catered, and heartfelt goodbyes are shared before the long generate-less vacation.
