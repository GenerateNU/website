        Every semester ends with our culminating event: Showcase. We get all
        fancied-up and celebrate the semesters' accomplishments with our
        teammates, clients, friends, families, professors and peers. Completed
        projects are shown off in all their glory, delicious food is catered,
        and heartfelt goodbyes are shared before the long generate-less
        vacation.
