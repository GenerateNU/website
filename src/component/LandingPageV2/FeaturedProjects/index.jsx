            Every semester, we work closely with Northeastern ventures to
            provide product development support. Clients of Generate make
            significant progress towards the production of their product and
            often leave with a working prototype, and possible IP. We’ve had
            some exciting projects over the years! Check out what we’ve worked
            on so far
