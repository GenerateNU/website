    bio: "I’m Josh Batra, the Executive Director! I am a 4th year Mechanical Engineer from Needham, MA and this is my 5th semester in Generate. Previously I’ve been a Project Lead, Hardware Engineer, and the Hardware Director. Generate has been a huge piece of my college experience and my favorite part is the friends I’ve been able to make in the org. Outside of Generate I play trumpet in the Pep Band and love watching or playing soccer! Management does a lot of high level planning and alignment with Mosaic, the Sherman Center, and Northeastern. We act as a resource for all teams and help them be successful.",
